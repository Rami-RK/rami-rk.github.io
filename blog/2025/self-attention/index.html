The ‘self-attention’ is a little different from the attention mechanism used in the RNN-based encoder-decoder model. Let’s first try to understand the intuition before delving into mathematical details and equations.</p> <p>The primary function of self-attention is to generate context-aware vectors from the input sequence itself rather than considering both input and output as in the RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture. See the example below shown in Fig. 1 (Ref. Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/self-attention/attention_matrix-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/self-attention/attention_matrix-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/self-attention/attention_matrix-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/attention_matrix.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1</figcaption> </figure> <p>In this example, there are 7 sequences in the sentence ‘the train left the station on time’, and we can see a 7x7 attention score matrix. For the time being, let’s say we somehow obtained these attention score values.</p> <p>According to the self-attention scores depicted in the picture, the word ‘train’ pays more attention to the word ‘station’ rather than other words in consideration, such as ‘on’ or ‘the’. Alternatively, we can say the word ‘station’ pays more attention to the word ‘train’ rather than other words in consideration, such as ‘on’ or ‘the’.</p> <p>The attention scores of each word in a sequence with all other words can be calculated, and the same is shown in the figure as a 7x7 score matrix. The self-attention model allows inputs to interact with each other (i.e., calculate the attention of all other inputs with one input).</p> <p>Attention scores help in understanding the contextual meaning of a word in a given sentence. For example, here the word ‘station’ has been used in the context of a train station, not in other contexts like a gas station or a bus station, etc.</p> <p>The attention score is computed through cosine similarity, i.e., the dot product of two-word vectors, which assesses the strength of their relationship or the degree of similarity between the compared words. There are many other mathematical aspects to consider, which will be discussed subsequently.</p> <p>These attention scores are utilized as weights for calculating the weighted sum of all the words in the sentence. For example, when representing the word ‘station’, the words closely related to ‘station’ will contribute more to the sum (including the word ‘station’ itself), while irrelevant words will contribute almost nothing. The resulting vector serves as a new representation of the word ‘station’, incorporating the surrounding context. Specifically, it includes part of the ‘train’ vector, thereby clarifying that it is, indeed, a ‘train station’.</p> <p>Let’s understand the above paragraph by writing a mathematical equation as given below, where \(A(i), \alpha(i,j)\) are weighted sum (termed as attention vector) and attention scores (weights) respectively, and individual word vector is represented by \(x_j\) . \(T_x\) represents the total number of terms in the sequence.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong> : The attention vector and weights can be written as: \(A(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha(i,j) x_j\)</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfolding the equation for the word “train”:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/self-attention/unfolding_attention_vector-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/self-attention/unfolding_attention_vector-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/self-attention/unfolding_attention_vector-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/unfolding_attention_vector.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1 (unfolding)</figcaption> </figure> <p>This process is iterated for every word in the sentence, yielding a new sequence of vectors that encode the sentence.</p> <hr> <h3 id="calculation-of-attention-weights">Calculation of Attention Weights</h3> <p>Before delving into the mathematical details of the self-attention mechanism, let’s revisit the equations and terms derived from the attention mechanism in RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures (as explained in my initial article: ‘Birth of Attention Mechanism’). Although it’s not necessary, to begin with the RNN-based attention mechanism to grasp self-attention, comparing term by term would facilitate comprehension and help us understand how identical concepts are used in both.</p> <p>A conceptual diagram is shown in Fig. 2 below to depict the attention mechanism in the RNN-based encoder-decoder model, where symbols have their usual meaning.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/self-attention/context_vector-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/self-attention/context_vector-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/self-attention/context_vector-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/context_vector.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="40%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Figure 2</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Recall: in the case of Attention in RNN based encoder-decoder model:</strong></p> <p><strong>Context vector:</strong> \(C(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha_{i,j} h(j)\)</p> <p><strong>Score:</strong> \(e_{i,j} = f(S_{i-1}, h_j)\)</p> <p><strong>Attention score</strong> (SoftMax of score): \(\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(e_{i,j})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T} \exp(e_{i,k})}\)</p> <h3 id="self-attention">Self-Attention</h3> <p>In Self-Attention, we get rid of RNN units and calculate the context-aware vectors from the input sequence itself. A conceptual diagram is shown in Fig. 3 below to depict the Self-attention. Suppose we have a sequence of feature vectors (embeddings) \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_T\)., in this case, T equals 4. We can use the concept of cosine similarity, which measures sameness or relatedness, to calculate scores and finally obtain the SoftMax, which can be used in the context vector as given below.</p> <p>In the case of Self-attention, the score is cosine similarity, i.e. dot product of the input sequence with itself.

This means that for fixed inputs, these attention weights would always be fixed. In other words, there are no learnable parameters. This is problematic and needs to be fixed by introducing some learnable parameters that will make the self-attention mechanism more flexible and tunable for various tasks. To fulfill this purpose, three trainable weight matrices are introduced and multiplied with input Xi separately, and three new terms Queries(Q), Keys(K), and Values(V) come into the picture as given by the equations below. Vectorized implementation &amp; Shape tracking are also shown in subsequent steps.</p> <p>Assume input ‘X’ is a sequence of ‘T’ time steps or in simple words a sentence with ‘T’ words and each word is represented by an Embedding vector of dimension ‘d_model’.
