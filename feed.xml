The 'self-attention' is a little different from the attention mechanism used in the RNN-based encoder-decoder model. Let's first try to understand the intuition before delving into mathematical details and equations.</p> <p>The primary function of self-attention is to generate context-aware vectors from the input sequence itself rather than considering both input and output as in the RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture. See the example below shown in Fig. 1 (Ref. Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet).</p> <div class="image"> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/attention_matrix.png" alt="Figure 1" width="850" height="600"> <p>Figure 1</p> </div> <p>In this example, there are 7 sequences in the sentence 'the train left the station on time', and we can see there is a 7x7 attention score matrix. For the time being, let's say we somehow obtained these attention score values.</p> <p>According to the self-attention scores depicted in the picture, the word 'train' pays more attention to the word 'station' rather than other words in consideration, such as 'on' or 'the'. Alternatively, we can say the word 'station' pays more attention to the word 'train' rather than other words in consideration, such as 'on' or 'the'.</p> <p>The attention scores of each word in a sequence with all other words can be calculated, and the same is shown in the figure as a 7x7 score matrix. The self-attention model allows inputs to interact with each other (i.e., calculate the attention of all other inputs with one input).</p> <p>Attention scores help in understanding the contextual meaning of a word in a given sentence. For example, here the word 'station' has been used in the context of a train station, not in other contexts like a gas station or a bus station, etc.</p> <p>The attention score is computed through cosine similarity, i.e., the dot product of two-word vectors, which assesses the strength of their relationship or the degree of similarity between the words being compared. Obviously, there are many other mathematical aspects to consider, which will be discussed subsequently.</p> <p>These attention scores are utilized as weights for calculating the weighted sum of all the words in the sentence. For example, when representing the word 'station', the words closely related to 'station' will contribute more to the sum (including the word 'station' itself), while irrelevant words will contribute almost nothing. The resulting vector serves as a new representation for 'station': one that incorporates the surrounding context. Specifically, it includes part of the 'train' vector, thereby clarifying that it is, indeed, a 'train station'.</p> <div class="note"> <p>Let’s understand the above paragraph by writing a mathematical equation as given below, where \( A(i) \), \(\alpha(i,j)\) are weighted sum (termed as attention vector) and attention scores (weights) respectively, and individual word vectors are represented by \(x_j\). The ‘\(T_x\)' represents the total number of terms in the sequence.</p> \( A(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha(i,j) x_j \) </div> <p>Unfolding above equation, when i is equal to a word 'train' i.e. , i = train:</p> <div class="image"> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/unfolding_attention_vector.png" alt="Figure" width="650" height="400"> </div> <p>This process is iterated for every word in the sentence, yielding a new sequence of vectors that encode the sentence.</p> <h2 id="calculation-of-attention-weights">Calculation of Attention weights</h2> <p>Before delving into the mathematical details of the self-attention mechanism, let's revisit the equations and terms derived from the attention mechanism in RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures (as explained in my initial article: 'Birth of Attention Mechanism'). Although it's not necessary, to begin with the RNN-based attention mechanism to grasp self-attention, comparing term by term would facilitate comprehension and help us understand how identical concepts are used in both.</p> <p>A conceptual diagram is shown in Fig. 2 below to depict the attention mechanism in the RNN-based encoder-decoder model, where symbols have their usual meaning.</p> <div class="image"> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/context_vector.png" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="300"> <p>Figure 2</p> </div> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Recall, in case of Attention in RNN based encoder-decoder model:</strong></p> <p><strong>Context vector:</strong> \( C(i)=\sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha_{i,j}h(j) \)</p> <p><strong>score:</strong> \( e_{i,j} = f( S_{i-1}, h_j ) \)</p> <p><strong>Attention Score (SoftMax of score):</strong> \( \alpha_{i,j} = \frac{ \exp(e_{i,j})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T} \exp(e_{i,k})} \)</p> </div> <p>In Self-Attention, we get rid of RNN units and calculate the context-aware vectors from the input sequence itself. A conceptual diagram is shown in Fig. 3 below to depict the Self-attention. Suppose we have a sequence of feature vectors (embeddings) \( X_1 \), \( X_2 \) all the way up to \( X_T \), in this case, T equals 4. We can use the concept of cosine similarity, which measures sameness or relatedness, to calculate scores and finally obtain the SoftMax, which can be used in the context vector as given below.</p> <p>In case of Self attention, score is cosine similarity, i.e. dot product of input sequence with itself.</p> <p>Thus,</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>score:</strong> \( X_i ^{T}.

In other words, there are no learnable parameters. This is problematic and needs to be fixed by introducing some learnable parameters that will make the self-attention mechanism more flexible and tunable for various tasks. To fulfill this purpose, three trainable weight matrices are introduced and multiplied with input \( X_i \) separately, and three new terms Queries(Q), Keys(K), and Values(V) come into the picture as given by the equations below. Vectorized implementation & Shape tracking are also shown in subsequent steps.</p> <p>Assume input 'X' is a sequence of 'T' time steps or in simple words a sentence with 'T' words and each word is represented by an Embedding vector of dimension ' \( d_{model} \) '. Fig. 4 below is showing multiple sentence samples (Xi's) in rows S1, S2, S3, and so on, and words by column as ti=1, 2, 3, ..., ti=T, which is say, up to 100.</p> <div class="image"> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/input_data_sample.png" alt="Figure 4" width="550" height="300"> <p>Figure 4</p> </div> Notation and dimensions are followed as per the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762v6.pdf">‘ Attention Is All You Need’</a>.

The same kind of analogy exists in Self-attention Q, K, and V as well, as shown in Fig. 7 below.</p> <div class="image"> <img src="/assets/img/self-attention/database_inspiration.png" alt="Figure 7" width="600" height="250"> <p>Figure 7<p> </div> <p>In self-attention, every word acts as a query once, while the entire words in the sequence act as keys, and attention weights are calculated to figure out which key matches with the query.</p> <p>Finally, the words (represented as vectors) are treated as values, and attention weights are used to form a weighted sum of the values, resulting in an attention vector.

type="html" xml:base="https://rami-rk.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024 We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
