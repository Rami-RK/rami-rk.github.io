Welcome, everyone!

I am Ramendra, and I love being called **Rami**.

I am a passionate learner, educator, and I created this blog to share knowledge across
**Mathematics**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Machine Learning**. The content here spans a
broad spectrum--from mathematical and statistical foundations to modern AI, Machine Learning,
and Data Science applications.

In today's world, intelligent systems with heavy mathematics under the hood quietly power much
of what we interact with every day. I believe that understanding these foundations--whether you
come from a technical or non-technical background--empowers you to better navigate and shape the
future.

Through this blog, I aim to **demystify AI and Machine Learning**, breaking the notion that
they are complex or accessible only to a select few. With curiosity, consistency, and the right
mindset, anyone can begin this journey.

The real magic happens when **mathematics meets data, algorithms, and computational power**--
from personal machines to scalable cloud computing platforms. This is where ideas evolve into
meaningful, real-world impact.

**Currently working at Volkswagen (Scania)**, focused on real-world AI solutions from classical
ML to transformer-based NLP (BERT/GPT variants), RAG, and production MLOps/LLMOps on AWS.

#### 🚀Current Work
Multi-modal Document processing, OCR & multilingual NLP pipelines, Agents.

#### 💻Tech Stack
**Machine Learning, MLOps, Deep Learning, CV, NLP**: BERT, GPT, LLMs  
**Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch  
**AWS**: SageMaker, Bedrock, EC2, ECR-ECS-Fargate
